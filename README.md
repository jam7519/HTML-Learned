My first HTML project from Codecademy.  
This project contains a simple webpage about the Brown Bear, where I practiced the basics of HTML.

## What I Learned

- **HTML** stands for HyperText Markup Language and is used to create the structure and content of a webpage.
- Most HTML elements contain opening and closing tags with raw text or other HTML tags between them.
- HTML elements can be nested inside other elements (child and parent relationships).
- Any visible content should be placed within the opening and closing `<body>` tags.
- Headings and sub-headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`) are used to provide titles for sections of content.
- `<p>`, `<span>`, and `<div>` tags specify text or blocks.
- `<em>` and `<strong>` tags are used to emphasize text.
- Line breaks are created with the `<br>` tag.
- Ordered lists (`<ol>`) are numbered and unordered lists (`<ul>`) are bulleted.
- Images (`<img>`) and videos (`<video>`) can be added by linking to an existing source.
